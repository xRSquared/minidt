  <p><strong>MiniDT: a simple but powerful jinja compiler for SQL</strong></p>
</div>

MiniDT is a powerful tool that allows you to use Jinja2 templates to generate SQL queries.
It is designed to be a lightweight alternative to dbt, for cases where dbt is too much, and raw SQL is too little.
All without the need for a database connection, or a complex setup!
